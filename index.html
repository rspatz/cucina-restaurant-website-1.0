            </div>
            <p class="long-copy">
                The English translation of "Cucina" is "cooking" or "cookery." However, our aim for "Cucina" is that the word will also come to mean "hospitality" over time, as our name embodies not only the best food, but making our guests feel welcome and part of our family as well.

            </div>
                    <p class="long-copy">
                        Our head chef is extremely particular about the ingredients we choose for our award-winning dishes. All of our ingredients are fresh: Our herbs are harvested throughout the day, meats are brought in daily from a local meat market, all of our vegetables are from local farms, and cheeses from a local artisan. Every one of our ingredients are checked for freshness and high quality as they are brought in. If the quality is not up to our standards, those dishes are removed from the menu for that day.

                    <p class="long-copy">
                        Our dining room is a very elegant, open-floor design, with an abundance of privacy for our guests. Each meal includes complimentary mini bread loaves, freshly created by a local baker. We also offer gluten-free options, baked or cooked in a separate kitchen, to assure that cross- contamination with foods containing gluten is negligible. Again, we want our guests to feel that they are part of our family, and that attitude extends to food safety concerns as well as food quality and hospitality.
